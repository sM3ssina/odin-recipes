            Juicy and tender, it’s paired with pistachio-studded couscous and chili-roasted carrots, plus a creamy, tangy, garlicky sauce for drizzling over top.

            <li>1 Lemon</li>
            <li>2 tbps Yogurt</li>
            <li>1 tbps Tunisian Spice Blend</li>
            <li>10oz Chicken Cutlets</li>
            <li>12oz Carrots</li>
            <li>1/2oz Pistachios</li>
            <li>1/4oz Cilantro</li>
            <li>1 tsp Chili Flakes</li>
            <li>2 tbps Sour Cream</li>
            <li>2.5 cup Israeli Cousous</li>
            <li>1 Chicken Stock Concentrate</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. 
                Wash and dry all produce. 
                Peel and mince garlic. 
                Zest and quarter lemon. 
                Pat chicken* dry with paper towels. 
                In a medium bowl, combine Tunisian Spice, half the yogurt, half the garlic, 1 TBSP olive oil, a squeeze of lemon juice, 1 tsp salt, and pepper. 
                (For 4 servings, use 2 TBSP olive oil and 2 tsp salt.) Add chicken and turn to coat. Set aside to marinate.</li>

            <li>Trim, peel, and cut carrots on a diagonal into ½-inch-thick pieces. 
                Roughly chop pistachios. Roughly chop cilantro. Toss carrots on a baking sheet with a drizzle of olive oil, salt, and a pinch of chili flakes. 
                Roast on top rack until golden brown and tender, 20-25 minutes.</li>

            <li>While carrots roast, in a small bowl, combine sour cream and remaining yogurt with garlic to taste. 
                Season with salt and pepper. 
                Stir in water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency.</li>
            
            <li>Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large, preferably nonstick, pan over medium heat.
                Remove chicken from marinade; allow excess to drip off. 
                Add chicken to pan and cook until browned and cooked through, 6-8 minutes per side. 
                TIP: Cooking over medium heat helps prevent the marinade from burning. Lower heat if chicken begins to brown too quickly. 
                Turn off heat; transfer to a cutting board to rest. 
                Once cool enough to handle, slice chicken crosswise.</li>

            <li>Meanwhile, melt 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) in a small pot over medium-high heat. 
                Add pistachios and cook, stirring constantly, until lightly browned, 2-4 minutes. 
                Add couscous and a pinch of salt; cook, stirring, until toasted, 30 seconds. Stir in stock concentrate and ¾ cup water (1½ cups for 4). 
                Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to low. Cook until couscous is tender, 6-8 minutes. 
                Fluff couscous with a fork; stir in lemon zest and half the cilantro. 
                Season with salt and pepper.</li>

            <li>Divide chicken, couscous, and carrots between plates.
                Drizzle chicken with garlic sauce and sprinkle with remaining cilantro and with chili flakes if desired. 
                Serve with remaining lemon wedges on the side.</li>
        </ol>
