            </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Prep: Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. 
                Wash and dry all produce. Trim and quarter zucchini lengthwise; cut crosswise into ½-inch-thick pieces. 
                Trim and thinly slice mushrooms. Halve tomatoes. Mince chives. Quarter lemon.</li>
            
            <li>Cook Zucchini: Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. 
                Add zucchini and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and softened, 4-6 minutes. 
                Transfer to a medium bowl. </li>
             
            <li>Cook Mushrooms: Heat a large drizzle of olive oil in pan used for zucchini over medium-high heat.
                Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and slightly crispy, 5-7 minutes. 
                Turn off heat; season with salt and pepper, then transfer to bowl with zucchini. Wash out pan.</li>  
            
            <li>Cook Pasta: Once water is boiling, add penne to pot. Cook until al dente, 9-11 minutes. 
                Reserve 1 cup pasta cooking water, then drain well.</li>

            <li>Make Sauce: Meanwhile, heat 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) and a drizzle of olive oil in pan used for mushrooms over medium-high heat. 
                Add tomatoes and season with salt, pepper, and Italian Seasoning. Cook, stirring, until tomatoes are softened, 2-4 minutes. 
                Stir in half the chives and juice from half the lemon. Reduce heat to low, then stir in stock concentrate and ¼ cup reserved pasta cooking water (⅓ cup for 4). 
                Whisk in crème fraîche; season with salt and pepper.</li>

            <li>Finish and Serve: Add zucchini, mushrooms, and drained penne to pan with sauce; stir to combine. 
                Stir in 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) until melted. (TIP: If necessary, add more reserved pasta cooking water a splash at a time until penne is coated in a creamy sauce.) 
                Divide pasta between plates. Sprinkle with Parmesan and remaining chives. Serve with remaining lemon wedges on the side.</li>
        </ol>
